                                                <p> Our 6-meal plan is
                                                    perfect for a person looking for 6 dinners (or lunches!) a week. On average, our meals weigh in
                                                    at about 13 ounces and range from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger household, we do
                                                    offer a 12 meal per week subscription (it’s perfect for couples or a family of 4 looking for 3
                                                    meals per week). Plus, you can always order multiple subscriptions. </p>
